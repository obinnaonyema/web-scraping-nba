# Web Scraping NBA Player Data
Web scraping involves extracting data from websites. In this task, we web scrape basketball statistics from Wikipedia of some of the greatest basketball players. We perform some analysis on the data using Pandas and plot the results.

This is part of the Edx course "Python for Data Science" in conjunction with IBM.
